3,"Paul: Thank you for your kind words.  I do, indeed, have strong beliefs and don't hide them.  They are based on both facts and values.  I think the question of ""bias"" and ""prejudice"" comes into play when we're discussing beliefs and attitudes based on values.  One of our poster friends,  for example, often comments that being ""intolerant"" of a bias, for example, is, in itself, a bias.  This is, IMO, where the concept of ""irratonal antipathy"" is important.  If I dislike neo-Nazis because of their views on race, my antipathy is based on fact (knowledge of their views) and values (my belief that condemning others because of their race/religion is WRONG).  Were I to, instead, dislike all Germans, that, IMO, would represent a bias...an irrational antipathy...since not all Germans condemn others because of their race/religion.  I discuss the ""bias"" question in another response to you....

5,Let’s see if I understand this; Berkowitz announces a $14M surplus then he rails against Proposition 8 because it would constrain his ability to confiscate even more money from citizens. Berkowitz and his allies on the Assembly changed the tax cap language to facilitate confiscating greater amounts of citizen’s money. Now why would a mayor who professes fidelity with the taxpayers change the law to enable him to take more money from them? Probably because he plans to take more money from them.  Berkowitz said if Proposition 8 passes “it severely constrains our ability to give out property tax relief.”  So Berkowitz wants the ability to confiscate more of the citizen’s money to provide property relief. How about taking less of that money in the first place?

Malama aina has been a traditional socio-cultural practice of Hawaiians and ALL Polynesian peoples for many many thousands of years. Malama aina roughly translates as ""nurture and sustain what feeds and provides for us"". It means that we must act ethically, sustainably and on a subsistence basis at ALL times whenever we take food or resources from nature,

To do this we take from nature only what we need to sustain ourselves and NOTHING more and we do nothing that might effect the natural balance of all living things.

The ""aquarium industry"" violates this basic Hawaiian principle because it takes reef fish for monetary profit NOT for subsistence.

And we'll have to go on imagining, since Federal policymakers at Health Canada and elsewhere have rigged things so that independent labs are not legally permitted to test dispensary MJ or they could lose their lab licences.

195,"Junior is either an uneducated moron or a shameless pathological liar. Frankly I’ll argue it’s both. No matter how many times these shameless liars claim we hate Latino’s the issue remains; we hate illegal immigration and our laws not being enforced. As for this profound stupidity demonizing our corn, this staggering hypocrite has absolutely no problem with Mexico exporting cheap agriculture produce to America that created thousands of jobs in Mexico and South America. While Junior laughably claims we have killed thousands of corn growing jobs in Mexico, this clueless wonder says nothing of the tens of thousands of manufacturing jobs we exported to Mexico.
As for our unconstitutional illegal war on drugs, this has exposed naked just how corrupt the Mexican government is. Legalize all drugs and Mexico is still ran by criminals as they have ALWAYS been a corrupt country.",1,eng,0.67142856,0.042857144,0.18571429,0.0,0.64285713,0.24285714,0.0,0.9234948754310608,0.6987116932868958,0.41069555282592773,0.28226974606513977,0.004178269766271114,0.02162977121770382,1
