Yes, just what we need in this discussion: more of the imaginary. The imaginary has been haunting MJ since 1923 when it was outlawed in Parliament without debate; the imaginary is what led it to being added to the Narcotic Control Act of 1961, which had the dubious honour of placing cannabis on a controlled substances list with heroin, cocaine, and, ultimately, meth-amphetamines; and the police-imaginary helped fuel public beliefs in growers as gangsters (which I refute above).

And we'll have to go on imagining, since Federal policymakers at Health Canada and elsewhere have rigged things so that independent labs are not legally permitted to test dispensary MJ or they could lose their lab licences.
